# Mingle

This repository can be used in two ways:
- To perform inference from any type of time series of data, labeled at each time stamp
- To synthesize some arbitrary input sensor data

synthethic_data_example.py shows how to synthesize some input data and explains you how to modify them.
classification_example.py shows an example of inference with some classifiers given some synthethic data.

sensitivity_analysis.py and sensitivity_input_features.py show examples of sensitivity analyses and use all classifiers available.
To use those, you will need to install Google Tensorflow.
